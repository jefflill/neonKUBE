**neonSDK:** A new home for general purpose libraries.

We're expecting NEONKUBE to be ready for a public preview in jUNE 2023 and one of our TODOs has 
been to relocate the general purpose Neon libraries to their own GitHub repo since these will be versioned
independently from NEONKUBE.  We finally relocated the non **Neon.Kube.*** libraries to:

[neonSDK repo](https://github.com/nforgeio/neonSDK)

NEONKUBE is an open source project released under the Apache-2.0 license.

### Maintainers:

See [DEVELOPER.md](Doc/DEVELOPER.md) for setup instructions.

**NOTE:** The build environment for this project is quite complex and right now
and is not really in a condition for non-maintainers to participate.  We will be
doing a pass to help simplify and make this work for non-maintainers at some 
point, probably after we launch this product.
