# Creates a ZIP archive that includes all of the NeonKUBE source files.
# This deletes all build binary files as well as all other files 
# (e.g. Go vendor files) that are not part of the source tree before
# generating the archive.
#
# USAGE: pwsh -f neon-archive.ps1 [-target PATH]
#
# OPTIONS:
#
#       -target PATH    - optionally specifies where the archive file
#                         should be written.  This defaults to:
#                       
#                           C:\NeonKUBE.zip

param 
(
	$target = "C:\NeonKUBE.zip"
)

# Import the global solution include file.

# Initialize

# This removes the [$/Build], [$/Build-cache], and all [bin] and [obj] folders.

# Remove the contents of [$/packages].

# I would have used [Compress-Archive] here but that throws an [OutOfMemoryException].
# It appears that this stupid Cmdlet actually loads the entire collection of files
# being archived into RAM and this exceeds default Powershell RAM allocation (GRRR...)
#
# We'll use [7-zip] instead.
