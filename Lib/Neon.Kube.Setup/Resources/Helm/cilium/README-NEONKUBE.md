# NEONKUBE Helm chart modifications

This documents how we modified the standard Cilium Helm charts and relocated them here.

1. Download the Cilium Helm charts from here: https://github.com/cilium/charts/tree/master

   You'll need to download the **cilium-VERSION.tgz** file for the target release by
   clicking on that file link and then clicking on the **Raw button** or **View raw**
   link.

2. Use **7-zip** to extract the Helm files.
