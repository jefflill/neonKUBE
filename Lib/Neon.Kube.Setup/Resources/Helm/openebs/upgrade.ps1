# We're having trouble with the [mayastor] dependency: Helm complains about
# its [loki-stack] subchart which doesn't make a lot of sense (something
# about a missing [Makefile] or something).
#
# It looks like [loki-stack] might have been deprecated so we're going to remove
# this subchart from the [mayastor] chart since we don't want to use it anyway
# since we have our own Loki deployment.
