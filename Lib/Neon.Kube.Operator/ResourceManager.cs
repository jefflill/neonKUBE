// $todo(jefflill):
//
// We don't currently do anything with non-null [ResourceControllerResult] returned by [ReconcileAsync()].
// I'm not entirely sure what the semantics for this are.  I assume that:
//
//      1. a subsequent DELETE will cancel a pending RECONCILE
//      2. a subsequent ADD/UPDATE will cancel (or replace?) a pending RECONILE
//      3. a subsequent MODIFY will cancel a pending RECONCILE
//
// Note also that DeletedAsync() and StatusModified() should also return an optional requeue result.
//
// I need to do some more research.  neonKUBE isn't currently depending on any of this.

        //
        // NOTE: It's very possible that the old KubeOps behavior was invalid and the current
        //       behavior actually is correct.
        //
        // This completely breaks our logic where we expect to see an IDLE event after
        // all of the existing resources have been discovered or when no resources were
        // discovered.
        //
        // We're going to work around this with a pretty horrible hack for the time being:
        //
        //      1. We're going to use the [nextNoChangeReconcileUtc] field to track
        //         when the next IDLE event should be raised.  This will default
        //         to the current time plus 1 minute when the resource manager is 
        //         constructed.  This gives KubeOps a chance to discover existing
        //         resources before we start raising IDLE events.
        //
        //      2. After RECONCILE events are handled by the operator's controller,
        //         we'll reset the [nextNoChangeReconcileUtc] property to be the current
        //         time plus the [reconciledNoChangeInterval].
        //
        //      3. The [NoChangeLoop()] method below loops watching for when [nextNoChangeReconcileUtc]
        //         indicates that an IDLE RECONCILE event should be raised.  The loop
        //         will instantiate an instance of the controller, hardcoding the [IKubernetes]
        //         constructor parameter for now, rather than supporting real dependency
        //         injection.  We'll then call [ReconcileAsync()] ourselves.
        //
        //         The loop uses [mutex] to ensure that only controller event handler is
        //         called at a time, so this should be thread/task safe.
        //
        //      4. We're only going to do this for RECONCILE events right now: our
        //         operators aren't currently monitoring DELETED or STATUS-MODIFIED
        //         events and I suspect that KubeOps is probably doing the correct
        //         thing for these anyway.
        //
        // PROBLEM:
        //
