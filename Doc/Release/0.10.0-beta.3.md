# Details

This is a fully functional NEONKUBE release that is based on KUBERNETES v1.24 which is
no longer supported.  We're in the process upgrading to KUBERNETES v1.29 which is scheduled
to be released early December 2023.  We're also planning on switching from the [Calico](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/about/)
CNI to [Cilium](https://cilium.io/get-started/) for better performance due to their **eBPF**
network proxy implementation as well as their service mesh.

This is categorized as a **BETA** release because we're expecting the Kubernetes and Cilium
changes to introduce breaking changes.
