# Description

This release includes the fully functional NEONDESKTOP app as well as the **neon** client tool, both of which can be
used to deploy and manage NEONKUBE Kubernetes clusters.  This is mostly feature-complete.

Our main focus going forward is to upgrade from Kubernetes v1.24 (which is at end-of-life) to Kubernetes v1.27 and we'll
probably be upgrading some of the include 3rd party components as well.  Breaking changes before the final release
are likely.
