This release is **not a production ready** and is intended to introduce new features and fixes.
This release is suitable for testing purposes but be advised that prerelease  features may see
breaking changes in future releases or be removed completely.

The **NeonDESKTOP cluster** is having trouble stabilizing due to **ephemeral** storage constraints.
We'll have a look at this for the next release.
