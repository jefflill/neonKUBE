# Description

This is an internal release published while testing our release process and tools.  The features should be the same
as the previous **v0.10.0-beta.1** release.

Our main focus going forward is to upgrade from Kubernetes v1.24 (which is at end-of-life) to Kubernetes v1.27 and we'll
probably be upgrading some of the include 3rd party components as well.  Breaking changes before the final release
are likely.
